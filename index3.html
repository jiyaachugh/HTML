    <P>
Example: Imagine you have a dataset with housing prices. You're trying to predict house prices based 
on features like size, number of bedrooms, and location. When you use this complex polynomial 
regression model to predict prices for new houses, it performs poorly because it's too sensitive to 
the training data's noise. It might even predict Wrong Prediction

        <h2>Overfitting</h2>
        example text - Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well to the extent that it captures noise 
        or random fluctuations in the data as concepts. Essentially, the model becomes too complex and fits 
        the training data too closely, which results in poor generalization to new, unseen data.
