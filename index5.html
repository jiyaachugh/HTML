    Discuss the role of Machine learning in fraud detection, medical diagnosis and email 
    spam detection. 
    <h1> Fraud Detection: </h1>
    <ul>
<li> Machine learning is extensively used in fraud detection across various industries, including 
finance, insurance, and e-commerce.</li>
<li> Supervised learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random 
forests, are employed to build models that learn from historical fraud data.</li> </ul></p>


   <p>  <ul>
 <h1>Medical Diagnosis:</h1>
<li> Machine learning contributes significantly to medical diagnosis and healthcare decision making processes.</li>
    <li> Supervised learning algorithms are used to train models on labeled medical data, such as 
patient records, diagnostic images, and laboratory results.</li>
<li>These models can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient 
outcomes, and recommending personalized treatment plans</li> </ul>
 </p>

 <p> <h1>Email Spam Detection:</h1>
<li> Email spam detection is one of the earliest and most widely adopted applications of machine 
learning in cybersecurity.</li>
<li> Supervised learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs), and 
ensemble methods, are commonly used to classify emails as either spam or legitimate 
(ham)</li> <p></p>
